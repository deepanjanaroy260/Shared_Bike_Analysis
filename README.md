# Shared_Bike_Analysis
Python libraries used numpy, pandas, sklearn linear regression and for Visualization using matplotlib and seaborn. Various techniques used for exploratory data analysis.
# Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system provides bikes for short-term use, either for a fee or for free, allowing individuals to borrow and return bikes at different docks within the same system.

BoomBikes, a US-based bike-sharing provider, has experienced a significant drop in revenue due to the COVID-19 pandemic and is struggling to stay afloat. To address this, the company plans to develop a strategic business plan to boost revenue once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers.

As part of this plan, BoomBikes aims to assess the demand for shared bikes post-quarantine to better prepare for increased demand and outshine competitors. They have engaged a consulting firm to analyze the factors influencing bike demand in the American market, including:

Identifying significant variables that predict bike demand.
Evaluating how well these variables explain demand patterns.
Using a comprehensive dataset on daily bike demand, collected through meteorological surveys and consumer behavior studies, you are tasked with modeling bike demand based on various independent variables. This model will help management understand how demand fluctuates with different factors, allowing them to adjust their business strategy accordingly and gain insights into the dynamics of a new market.
